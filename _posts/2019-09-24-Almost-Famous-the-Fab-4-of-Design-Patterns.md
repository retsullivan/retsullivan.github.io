Title:Almost Famous - The Fab 4 of Design Patterns
---

**Who needs the Fab 4 when you can have the Gang of 4?**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma" target="_blank">Erich Gamma</a>. Richard Helm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Johnson_(computer_scientist)" target="_blank">Ralph Johnson</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vlissides" target="_blank">John Vlissides</a>.  

These names may not conjure up the immediate recognition like John, Paul, Ringo, and George, but they are **rock stars** in the Object Oriented Programming community.

Seen here rocking some peak 1990s tech fashion, the "Group of 4" literally wrote the book on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>.  They did not invent these design patterns themselves; rather, they described and categorized patterns they had observed in a way that was concrete, concise, and applicable across the subject of Object Oriented Programming(OOP).  Their insights helped advance and explicitly define core concepts of OOP in a way that allowed programming to be classified as a specific engineering discipline for the first time. Though not often taught today (the book's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk" target="_blank">Smalltalk</a> examples are too dated), Design Patterns was the seminal treatise on the subject, and it remains an important and influential book. A more modern and accessible take on the subject, our bootcamp reference book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124" target="_blank">Head First Design Patterns</a> will be a useful tool as we enter the software development field. 


**What is a design pattern?**

A design pattern provides reusable solutions for developing software. To quote Tim, design patterns are "a way for programmers to convey a known structure of objects by having one word for it".  I'm looking forward to leaning more about the topic. In the meantime, I found a short bird's eye view summary of what Design Structures are <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/design_pattern" target="_blank">here.</a>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OlY9JCrjk7uvxffcAcwOa1yOtACNMfv-YUb5PcUrOUI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> are the design patterns covered in today's lecture. I'll update the spreadsheet to reflect tomorrow's talk.
