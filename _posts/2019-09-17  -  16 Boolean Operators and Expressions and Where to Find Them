title: 16 Boolean Operators and Expressions and Where to Find Them
---
##Boolean Logic

Boolean logic is a simple but powerful concept that is the foundation of many mathematical and scientific fields.  It is fundamental to software programming, because it is able to help developers breakdown complex statements into easy to digest logical formulas. 

Boolean logic uses bools (true and false values) to organize information. Bools are typically denoted as T or 1 for true and F or 0 for false.  A Boolean operator in Java programming is an operator that returns a Boolean result that’s based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions. Boolean variables can have two values - “true” or “false”.

##Using Boolean Logic on a single element

The negation operator can be written as “~” or “!”.. The term “~a” is read as “not a”. When applied to bools, we can create a truth table to list all the possible logical outcomes.

Truth Table for Variable Negation

a |!a
------------ | -------------
T|F
F|T


Truth Table for Bitwise Negation

a |~a
------------ | -------------
T|F
F|T















The three basic Boolean expressions are "and", "or", and "not". These three tools allow us to articulate a huge variety of logical concepts.
