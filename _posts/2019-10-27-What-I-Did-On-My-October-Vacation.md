## How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Week Off

The last 9 days have been productive and enjoyable, though they did not allow for as much focused Bootcamp study time as I had hoped.  I did learn several important things during the break that I can share.

## What I Learned

1) Don't make 6 week's worth of appointments for a family of 6 during one week.  Just don't.

2) Always check the date on a Pluralsight video on a topic you want to learn more about.  If not, you may waste hours learning the wrong thing before you realize the course is 6 years old.

3) Enjoy as much fun with your family as you can. They miss you and deserve your focus when you can give it.

4) Study as much as you can in the time you do have and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h34HEE_hZVS5NBoXPkmkyWj-WLkJxON4_4TOW4Yg5kk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">take good notes</a>.  

5) Don't promise Tim a blog post over a topic you might not get the chance to finish studying in the time allotted.
